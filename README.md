You talk about sacrifice? These hamsters know sacrifice.

When danger appears in orbit over Dzungaria, the crew of the Wheel V orbital base under the command of the General does not hesitate for a moment. They are ready to sacrifice their fluffy lives to defend their homeland, protect their food and ensure the safety of their offspring.

A comic book about love for the homeland and sacrifice, set in the black cosmic void.The universe has never been so fluffy and dangerous at the same time, but remember: in space no one will hear your squeaks...

This is the Game Boy (original) version of the 2019 short comic novella "Hamsters in space" by Bartek Biedrzycki.
